# CI/CD Pipeline for Microservices-Based E-Commerce Platform with Docker

This project involves the development of a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for a microservices-based e-commerce platform using Docker. The pipeline leverages GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery, and Docker Compose for local multi-service deployment.

## Introduction
The CI/CD pipeline for the e-commerce platform aims to streamline the development and deployment process by automating build, test, and deployment stages. The platform includes containerized microservices (user service and product service) that are consistently and scalably deployed using Docker.

## Features
- Automated build, test, and deployment processes using CI/CD.
- Containerization of microservices with Docker for consistent deployments.
- Continuous integration and delivery facilitated by GitHub Actions.
- Local multi-service deployment and testing with Docker Compose.

## Architecture
The system architecture includes the following components:
1. **Docker**: For containerizing the microservices (user service and product service).
2. **GitHub Actions**: For automating the CI/CD pipeline, including building Docker images and pushing them to Docker Hub.
3. **Docker Compose**: For local multi-service deployment and integration testing.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- GitHub account
- Docker Hub account

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-cicd-pipeline.git
    cd ecommerce-cicd-pipeline
    ```

2. Configure Docker Hub credentials in GitHub Actions secrets:
    - Go to your GitHub repository's settings.
    - Navigate to "Secrets and variables" > "Actions".
    - Add the following secrets:
        - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
        - `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password.

3. Update the Docker Compose configuration (`docker-compose.yml`) if necessary.

## Usage
1. **Local Development and Testing**:
    - Start the microservices locally using Docker Compose:
      ```sh
      docker-compose up
      ```
    - Access the services via the URLs specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
    - Push changes to the GitHub repository.
    - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger, building Docker images, running tests, and pushing images to Docker Hub.
    - Monitor the workflow runs in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.

## Technologies Used
- **Docker**: For containerizing microservices and ensuring consistent deployments.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Docker Compose**: For local multi-service deployment and testing.
